# QueueCup
QueueCup is a React-based market simulation platform that models a café as a live trading exchange. Each menu item behaves like a dynamic asset whose price changes based on user demand and transaction volume. The system demonstrates concepts such as real-time state management, dynamic pricing algorithms, and interactive UI design.
